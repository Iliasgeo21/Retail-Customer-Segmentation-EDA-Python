# 🛍️ Retail Customer Segmentation — EDA & Clustering (Python)

Customer segmentation project using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **K-Means clustering** to identify shopping behavior groups based on age, gender, annual income and spending score.

This project demonstrates data analyst skills including data cleaning, visualization, statistical insights and unsupervised machine learning.

## 📌 Key Insights

•	Spending does not correlate strongly with income

•	Younger customers tend to spend more

•	Clear cluster groups formed:

  o	High income, high spending
  
  o	High income, low spending
  
  o	Low income, high spending
  
  o	Average consumers
